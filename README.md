# BeeLogs
BeeLogs is an Open Source piece of software for beekeeping management.

Eventually when BeeLogs is built it will be hosted in the cloud and will be completely free to use. It will also be available for self hosting from this repository. The cloud servers will be purely funded through voluntary donations from its users.

## Contributing
I'm just going to level with you, I'm a beekeeper first and developer second. If you know how to develop on the Laravel framework I truly would be grateful of the help. As a thank-you I'll add your name to the contributors list below.

The more people who contribute the more awesome BeeLogs will be!
